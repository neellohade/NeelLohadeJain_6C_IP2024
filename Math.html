        <h1>Research on Aryabhata</h1> <!-- Corrected typo -->
        <p>Aryabhata became famous as a mathematician and astronomer. In his only surviving work, Aryabhatiya, he covered a wide range of topics, such as extracting square roots, solving quadratic equations, and predicting eclipses.</p>   
        <p>George Ifrah, a French mathematician, stated that the concept and understanding of zero as a 'digit' was first given by Aryabhata in his place value system. The counting system of digits is not possible without the place value system or zero.</p>
